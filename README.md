Rails Recipes 

Technologies - 
For this project, I used Ruby on Rails with a PSQL database accessed by Active Record. Rails allowed me to have uniform model relationships, as well as consistent and direct functionality over different views. 

Approach - 
I started the approach by creating an ERD that helped me to conceptualize the relationships that my app would be based on. Then, I created a rough wireframe to get the idea for the design of the website/how I would display the features. I also planned out user stories where I could flesh out the experience of the user, and how they might interact with the application. I started with basic functionality/getting items and pages to display in the desired manner. Then I added some CSS and layout to make the app more visually appealing. Once I had the basic structure functioning, I then began to add the more complex and in depth features

Features - 
Rails Recipes is an app where users can create shopping lists based off recipes they want to use. They can add/edit/remove recipes, and the ingredients automatically get added to a 'shopping list' that compiles all the ingredients they need to make their recipes. The app also has a weekly recipe schedule, where users can see which recipes they have planned out for the days of the week.

Unsolved Problems - I was unable to get the weekly schedule functioning 100% properly. Also, I wanted to add units of measurement to the ingredients/shopping list functionality, that would assign a unit (lbs, oz, etc) to the ingredients, that would aggregate when multiples of the same ingredients were added to the list. Ideally, the app will have access to an API of recipes where users can browse a large database of available recipes, and add the ones they want to their personalized list. I also wanted to have cooking instruction data added to each recipe, but I figured that would be more easily handles by using an API
